## Scenario
A library has found their book search system has become slower as their collection of books has
grown. They need you to design an efficient program which allows searching for books by title
and adding and removing books. You will be provided with a sample of book data in a text file,
which must be loaded by your program. It should however, be possible for your program to load
data from another file, e.g. by using a command line argument of the file name, to allow them to
later load the full list of all books in the collection.

### Objectives
* Read information from file
* Search data by **Title**
* Adding/Removing data
* Load new data, from a different text file, using CMI

### Book Class
* Title
* Author(s)
* ISBN
